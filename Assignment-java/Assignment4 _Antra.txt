1. What’s the difference between final, finally? What	is	finalize()?
   Final : it is a keyword and access modifier which is used to apply 
          restriction on a class ,mehod or variable

  Finally : it is block in java exception handling  which is executed 
            whether the exception occurs or not in a code

  Finalize : it is a method in java which is used to perform clean up 
             processing just before object is garbage collected

2. What’s the difference between throw and throws?
    Throw: The throw keyword is used inside a method or a block of code.

    Throws: The throws keyword is used with the method signature.
  
3. What are	the two types of exceptions?
    Checked Exception  and UnChecked Exception 

4. What is error in java?
   Error is an illegal operation performed by the user which results in the abnormal 
    working of the program. It can be classified into Runtime error and compile time 
    error


5. Exception is object,	true	or	false?
   TRUE

6. Can a finally block exist	with	a try	block	but	without a	catch?
    YES

7. From java 1.7, give	an example of the	try-resource feature.
    
  public void copyFile(File sourceFile, File destFile)
        throws IOException {
 
        FileChannel sourceChannel = null;
        FileChannel destChannel = null;
 
    try {
        sourceChannel = new FileInputStream(sourceFile).getChannel();
        destChannel = new FileOutputStream(destFile).getChannel();
        sourceChannel.transferTo(0, sourceChannel.size(), destChannel);
    } finally {
        if (sourceChannel != null) {
            sourceChannel.close();
        }
        if (destChannel != null) {
            destChannel.close();
        }
    }
}


8. What will happen to the Exception object after exception	handling?
   The Exception object will be garbage collected in the next garbage collecetion.

9. Can we use String as	a condition	in switch(str){} clause?
   YES

10. What’s the difference between ArrayList, LinkedList and	vector?

       Array List                           Linked list                                              Vector                    

  Array is collectio of  homogenous        It is  collection of  node (data and address            it is similar with array list to use 
  data type															   dyamic array but it is synchronized
  
  it maintain insertion order              it does not provide random access				  vector is slower than array list
  
  it provide random access
  
  it consusme less memory than             it store  the next and prevoius references along        vector implements a dynamcic array that means
  linked list					 with data so consume more memory                         it can grow or shrink as required
  
  Manupulation is solwer because if        it it fater being node based as not much bit shifting 
  elemets is remove then it have to        required
  shift all bits in memory 

  

11. What’s	the difference between	hashTable	and	hashMap?
    
    HashMap                                           HashTable
   
  No method is sunchronized			    Every  method is sunchronized
  
  No thread safe					    Thread safe
   
  Null is allowed for both key                Null is not allowed for both key and value
  value    
  
  It has fast performance because thread     it is slow performance because it increase 
   are not required to wait 			    waitoing time of the thread


12. What is	static import?
   Static import is a feature which provides the facility to access static members of a class directly 
    without using class name.


13. What is	static block?
    The static block is a block of statement inside a Java class that will be executed when a class is first loaded into the JVM. 
     A static block helps to initialize the static data members, just like constructors help to initialize instance members.

14. Explain	the	keywords:

     default(java 1.8)   : The default key word specifies some code to run if there is no case  match in the switch

     break  :        It is used to terminate loops and switch statements in java

     continue:     It is used to end the current iteration in a for loop or while loop and continues to the next iteration

     synchronized:  It is process of allowing only a single thread to access the shared data or resource at a particular point of time . 
   
     strictfp :     it ensure for getting same  result on every platform if you perform opertiona in the floating point variables

     transient:    Transient in Java is used to mark the member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes

     volatile:     Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads. It is also used to make classes thread safe.

     instanceOf:   Instance of keyword checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface


15. Create	a program including two	threads – thread	read	and	thread write.
Input	file	->Thread	read	->	Calculate	->	buffered area
Buffered area	->	Thread write	->	output file
Detailed	description	is in	assignment4.txt	file.
Sample input.txt	file.
Attached	files	are	input.txt and a	more	detailed	description	file
