1. What is JDK ? JRE ? JVM ?

JDK : 
     It stands for Java Development Kit  which provides environment for developing and
     running  java application
    JDK = Jre + Development tools


JRE: 
  It stands for Java Runtime Enviroment which provides environment only to run java application.
  JRE = JVM + Library classes

JVM :
 It stands for  Java Virtul Machine.
  it is a interpreater which is responsible to run our java programme line  by line.
 if any exception occur in any  line then the application stop working.
  

2. What is java Complier ?
  Java complier is a complier for the programming language java.
 A complier translates the entire source code into a machine-code file or any intermediate code,
 and that file can be used to get output on java class files or byte code


3. Why is java platform independent?
    
    because java compile code in ( .class file or byte code) which can run on all operating system whether in windows, linux, unix 
if the code is compile once it can run in any operating system but c  and c++ the code have to complile every single time it is 
being run in any other operating sytem

4. What is IDE and why it is important for developers?
   it stands for Integrated Development Environment.
it is a soft ware with useful functionalites for developers ,enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a 
computer program.

It is important because
it helps to increase programmer productivity by providing source code editor,
file managment, debugger, complier or interpreter, respository version control  etc.


5. Is Java case sensitive?
   Yes it is because the upper or lower case of the letter in your java programs matter.


6. What do the following keywords do?

static   :  The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
          it is a key word  which is  used to call a method /variables without any creation Of Obejct

public   :  They can be accessed from anywhere in the program. This means it can be used from the same or 
           different classes and the same or a different package.

final    : it is a keyword which is used to provide restriction to the user.
            Final : works based on situation
        final with varibales   : varibale will be constant
        final with methods     :methods cannot be overridden
        final with classs      :class not be inheritance


private  : They restrict the keywords to a higher level by not allowing them to be accessed from anywhere outside the class itself.

void     : it will not return anything.
 
null     : null is reserved words which is literal(value) similar to true and flase and it is anytype reference which means 
           [ array, class, interface, enum, annotaion]

package  : a package arrange number of classes,interfaces and sub-packages of same type into a paticular group

class    :it is a collection of methods, object , variables

new      : new keyword creats new objects and it is used to  allocate dynamic memory in run time



7. What is premitive type and referance type?
    
    Premitive type :
    Primitive data types in Java are predefined by the Java language and named as the reserved keywords.
     They are 8 types:
   1. int 
   2. long
   3. float
   4. double
   5. short
   6. char
   7. byte
   8. boolean


 Referece Type:  
      Reference datatypes in java are those which contains reference/address of dynamically created objects
          Classes, interfaces, arrays, enumerations, and, annotations are reference types in Java.
          Reference variables hold the objects/values of reference types in Java.
      

8. Is parameter  passed  by value or reference?
  it is usually passed by value,however it depend upon context if we're dealing with Primitives or Objects: 
 For Primitive types, parameters are pass-by-value. For Object types, the object reference is pass-by-value.



9. what is the output: System.out.println(1>0:"A":"B");

        it will give you a compile time errors


10. How to define constants in java ?
        by using final key word  we can make constants


11. What is String ? Is it primitive type?
  String are object that allows us to store sequence of character which may conatin
  alpha-numeric value enclosed in double closed.
  it is immutable in java  if u create a object of string then you coulnot change later
   it conatins  methods that can perform certain opertions on string they are:
  concat(), equals(), length() etc..

It is non premetitvdata types because it stores references.



12.  How to check if a String is representing a number?
        We could use Integer.valueOf() method to convert string.If it does work then this string[
       is representing a number
         
13. Write a program to implement the following activity diagram.



14. Write a program to merge two array of int
    
      public class CheckIn {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		int [] arr1 = {1,3,5,7};
		int [] arr2= {2,4,6,8};
		
		 int  abc = arr1.length;
		 int  bcd = arr2.length;
		 int xyz = abc+bcd;
		 
		 int[] newArr = new int[xyz];
		 for(int i=0;i<abc;i++) {
			 newArr[i]=arr1[i];
		 }
		 for(int i =0;i<bcd;i++) {
			 newArr[i+abc]=arr2[i];
		 }
		
		 System.out.println(Arrays.toString(newArr));
		
	}

}


15. Write a program to find the second largest number insid an array of int.

     public class findSecondLargeNum {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	int arr[] = {213,5,9,8,10,15};
	Arrays.sort(arr);
	System.out.println(arr[arr.length-2]);
	}

}
