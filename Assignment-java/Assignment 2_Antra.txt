1.  Why we need packages in java ?
     it helps to group the related class together  hence providing convenience and order.
     Its like a folder in a file which keeps maintainable code in visibility and accessibility.

2. What is the default imported package?
    Java compiler imports " java.lang package " internally by default. It provides the fundamental classes 
    that are necessary to design a basic Java program. 
  
3. What is Class? What is object ? 
  Class is a blueprint of an object which contains  methods, object , variables.
  
  Object : it is a instance of class that execute class.Once the object is created
           it takes a space like other variable in memory


4. Why we need constructor?
   Constructor is the first method that is invoke when you create an object. 
    The main reason for having the constructor is to initialize the variables

5. What is the default  value of local variable? What is the default value of instance
   variable?
   
   local variable :  The local variable do not have any default value;
    
   Instance Variable : Instance variable have default values like for number default value is 0,
                      Boolean it is false, Object referneces it is null.
 
6. What is garbage collection ?
    it is an automatic process of java which perfrom memory managment by deleting unused objects

7. The protected data can be accessed by subclasses or same package.Ture or False ?
    TRUE

8. What is immutable class ?
    it means once object is created we cannot change the content or its value.
   for that : class should be final 
              variable should be private and final
              setter method shouldnot be exist 

9. What is the difference between "==" and equals method ?
   " =="       --> It is majorly used to compare the reference values and objects.
    "equals"  ---> It is used to compare the actual content of the object.

10. What is wrapper class ?
    Wrapper class is used to convert primitive data type into object and vice-versa.

11. What is autoboxing ?
     Auto boxing : it is the conversion of primitive data type  to object 

12. StringBuilder is threadsafe but slower than StringBuffer, true or false ?
     False

13. Constructor can be inherited, true or false ?
     False

14. How to call a super class's constructor ?
    By Using "Super Keyword "

15. Which class is the super class of all classes ?
    Object Class

16. Create a program to count how many files/folders are there inside the folder.
    . the count method should take a parameter called Criteria like this :
       count (Criteria criteria){}
    . for Criteria class multiple condiitons should be included such as :folder
	path includeSubFolder or not the extension of the file be counted and so  on
    .Optional:Take the input from keyboard
    . Take  care of the invalid inputs.Exception handling
    . Get proper result displayed
    . "There are XXX files and XXX foldrs inside folder XXX with extension XXX or 
      something user friendly.
